A rotating 3-plate fan consists of three blades that are angled to create a rotational force when spun. The cubic root of 1 is used in the design of the 
fan to ensure that the blades are evenly spaced around the central axis.

To understand this, we can start by considering the unit circle in the complex plane, which is a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. The cubic roots
of 1 are the three complex numbers that satisfy the equation z^3 = 1.

These roots can be expressed in polar form as:

1 = 1(cos(0) + i*sin(0))
-1/2 + i*(√ (3)/2) = 1(cos(2π/3) + i*sin(2π/3)) = e^(i*(2π/3))
-1/2 - i*(√ (3)/2) = 1(cos(4π/3) + i*sin(4π/3)) = e^(i*(4π/3))

Now, let's consider the three blades of the fan as being positioned at the three roots of 1 in the complex plane. We can then rotate the fan by an angle of
2π/3 radians (or 120 degrees) to move each blade to the next root.

(Point to be noted: The three cubic roots of 1 are spaced evenly around the unit circle in the complex plane, with each root separated by an angle of 
360/3 = 120 degrees.

To see why this is the case, you can think of the three roots as lying at the vertices of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the unit circle. Each vertex
corresponds to one of the roots, and the sides of the triangle are formed by the radii connecting the center of the circle to the vertices.

Since an equilateral triangle has all three angles equal to 60 degrees, the angle at the center of the circle subtended by each side of the triangle is 
120 degrees. This means that the angle between any two consecutive roots of unity is 120 degrees, and the roots are evenly spaced around the circle.)

By doing this, we ensure that the blades are evenly spaced around the central axis, which results in a smooth and balanced rotation. If the blades were 
not evenly spaced, it would create an imbalance in the fan, which could lead to vibration, noise, and reduced efficiency.

Therefore, the cubic root of 1 plays an important role in the design of the rotating 3-plate fan by ensuring that the blades are evenly spaced and the 
fan operates smoothly.
