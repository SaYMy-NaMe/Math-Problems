Question:

Find the sum of the first n terms of the series:
-4, -1, 4, 11, ...

Answer:
The first four terms of the series are: -4, -1, 4, 11

1st term: -4
2nd term: -1 (i.e., -4 + 3 + 0)
3rd term: 4 (i.e., -4 + 3 + 5 = -4 + 3 + 3 + 2)
4th term: 11 (i.e., -4 + 3 + 5 + 7 = -4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4)

It’s evident that the numbers being added are increasing in an odd pattern: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...

So the next terms would be:

5th term: 20 (i.e., -4 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = -4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 6)
6th term: 31 (i.e., -4 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = -4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8)
7th term: 44 (i.e., -4 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = -4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10)
... and so on.

Now the total sum up to n terms would be:

Sum = (-4) + (-1) + 4 + 11 + 20 + 31 + 44 + ...

We observe the following:

The term (-4) appears in each of the n terms, so its total contribution is n × (-4).

Now, let's consider the term 3:

In the 1st term: appears 0 times → 3×0

2nd term: 1 time → 3×1

3rd term: 2 times → 3×2

4th term: 3 times → 3×3

...

nth term: appears (n−1) times → 3×(n−1)

So the total contribution from all the 3's:

3 × (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n−1)) = 3 × [n(n−1)/2]

Now observe another pattern involving the even numbers:

3rd term includes: 2 = 2×1

4th term includes: 2 + 4 = 2(1 + 2)

5th term: 2 + 4 + 6 = 2(1 + 2 + 3)

6th term: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 2(1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

nth term: 2(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n−2))

Adding all of these contributions gives:

2×[1×(n−2) + 2×(n−3) + 3×(n−4) + ... + (n−2)×1]
This sum simplifies to:
(1/3) × n × (n−1) × (n−2)

Final Formula:

So, the total sum of the first n terms is:
Sum = n×(-4) + 3n(n−1)/2 + (1/3)×n(n−1)(n−2)

Where:

The first term is a = -4

The incremental pattern is in odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, 9, ...

This formula works only for this specific type of series, where the increment follows the pattern 3, 5, 7, 9... (i.e., consecutive odd numbers).

Thank you!
