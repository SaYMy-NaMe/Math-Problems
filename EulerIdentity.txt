The equation e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 is often considered beautiful due to its elegant simplicity and deep connections to various areas of mathematics.

Firstly, it involves five of the most important mathematical constants: e, i, π, 1, and 0, making it a powerful symbol of unity in the mathematical world.

Secondly, it relates two seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics - complex analysis and number theory - in a way that reveals surprising patterns and connections.

Thirdly, it is a prime example of the beauty of symmetry, as it involves a complex number (e^(iπ)) that is equidistant from both the origin and the point -1 in the complex plane.
